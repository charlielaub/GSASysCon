Installing the ACDf LADSPA plugin:


The ACDf filter plugin is installed like any other LADSPA plugin. The LADSPA
SDK must be installed first. Complete instructions can be found below.


Before installing the plugin you must install the ladspa sdk and the Gstreamer 
LADSPA host plugin, e.g:
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt -y install ladspa-sdk gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
If either of these have already been installed apt will inform you about it.

Next, add the following path to the end of your .profile file in your home 
directory so that the OS knows where to find LADSPA object files:
   export LADSPA_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ladspa:/usr/lib/ladspa
Open the .profile file with an editor, add the line at the end, and then save 
the file and exit the editor. For this change to take effect you must logout 
and then log back in to your account (or reboot).

Now that LADSPA is installed on the system we are now ready to install ACDf. 
In the directory:
   system_control/LADSPA
you will find subdirectories for the ACDf plugin and one or more optional
LADSPA plugins.  

To install ACDf, first enter the ACDf directory. You should see files such as:
ACDf.cpp, README, makefile, etc. In a bash shell, type:
   make
followed by:
   sudo make install

If either of these commands produces an error you may be missing some tools that 
the OS needs to compile and build the code. These can be installed with the 
command:
   sudo apt install build-essential
Then try make and sudo make install again.

To check for success and to list all installed LADSPA plugins, type
   listplugins
or
   gst-inspect-1.0 ladspa
ACDf should be found within the output of these commands.

You are welcome to install any other LADSPA plugins at this time.
