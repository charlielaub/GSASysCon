# Behringer UMC1820 example system configuration file with software volume
#   adjustment of one analog input pair. Input is taken from analog input jacks
#   1 and 2 on the rear panel, and output is all 10 analog outputs plus the
#   SPDIF output. The interface has been configured to have 12 output channels
#   via the front panel (see UMC1820 manual for info).
# Replace placeholder comments "...DSP statement" with actual ACDf filters or
#   short-name DSP crossovers from the filter definition files.
# Create a new folder in system_control/system_info and save this file in it 
#   with your edits under the name "system_configuration". It should appear as
#   a new sytem in the GSASysCon control interface



#set the input/source for the Gstreamer pipeline to the UMC1820 with 
#   10 channels of 96kHz 32bit audio. Note when opening the UMC1820 you must 
#   read all 10 channels even if you only need a subset of them.
