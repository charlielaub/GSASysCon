Usage Notes for LADSPA plugin ACDf version 4.x
Updated September 2024

Info:
The ACDf LADSPA plugin can implement a wide variety of first and second order 
filters. ACD refers to the Active Crossover Designer, a set of Excel based 
tools for designing active crossovers for loudspeakers using acoustic 
measurements of the system. ACD can be found on the web at:
http://audio.claub.net/software/ACD/ACD.html

LADSPA is a platform for implementing audio processing algorithms as "plugins" 
that are called by a host program. Some examples of host programs include 
ecasound (Linux), ALSA (Linux), and Gstreamer (Linux and Windows). Before use, 
plugins must be compiled for the operating system under which the host is 
running. This process is is simplified using a makefile.  

================================================================================
Using the LADSPA ACDf plugin:

ACDf is invoked as a Gstreamer element from within GSASysCon (see examples 
provided below). Up to seven parameters are used to describe the filter. The 
parameters control the behavior of each filter type:

PARAMETER    WHAT IT DOES
type         indicates which filter type to implement (see below)
polarity     -1 reverses polarity. polarity is unchanged for any other number
db           passband gain for the filter in dB, or PEQ band gain
fp           sets the frequency of the filter pole in Hz 
qp           sets the Q factor of the filter pole 
fz           sets the frequency of the filter zero in Hz 
qz           sets the Q factor of the filter zero

Most filter types can be described using only a few of the 7 parameters.
The following table lists which parameters should be specified for each filter
type: 

ACDf filter types and their required parameters:
TYPE   DESCRIPTION                 REQUIRED PARAMETERS
 0     gain block                  db, polarity 
 1     1st order LP                db, polarity, fp
 2     1st order HP                db, polarity, fp
 3     1st order AP                polarity, fp
 4     1st low shelf               fp, db
 5     1st high shelf              fp, db
21     2nd order LP                db, polarity, fp, qp, 
22     2nd order HP                db, polarity, fp, qp
23     2nd order AP                polarity, fp, qp
24     2nd order low shelf         db, polarity, fp, qp
25     2nd order high shelf        db, polarity, fp, qp
26     parametric EQ               db, fp, qp
27     2nd order notch             db, polarity, fp, qp, fz
28     biquadratic filter          db, polarity, fp, qp, fz, qz
77     2nd order notch             polarity, fp, qp, fz (see TYPE 77, below)

NOTES:

TYPE 77:
This type is used to implement lowpass and highpass notch filters. For the
lowpass notch filter, the db "gain correction" is automatically applied so that
the DC gain of the lowpass remains 0dB. Any user supplied value for db will be
ignored.  

SHELF FILTERS:
For filter types 4,5 and 24,25 the value supplied for "fp" is used to set the 
center frequency of the shelf transition. For the '2nd order low shelf' and 
'2nd order high shelf' the value suppied as qp determines the Q value where 
the filter curve enters and leaves the transition. To reproduce a 2nd order shelf
filter with asymmetric shapes use the general biquadratic filter (type 28) and
specify qp and qz separately.

DEFAULTS:
Each parameter has a default value if none is provided by the user. The following
table lists the default values:
PARAMETER    DEFAULT VALUE
type         0 (gain block)
polarity     1 (normal polarity)
dB           0 (no gain or cut)
fp           440 Hz 
qp           1.0 
fz           440 Hz 
qz           1.0

Some hints for constructing loudspeaker crossovers:
Loudspeaker crossovers are often known by names such as Butterworth, Linkwitz-
Riley, etc. These are simply combinations of first and second order filters with
specific Qp values for the second order stage(s). The following provides a guide
for constructing some of the more common crossover types:

    1st order    Q       Q       Q       Q
LR2             0.5
BUT2            0.707
BUT3     X      1.0
LR4             0.707   0.707
BUT4            0.54    1.31
BUT5     X      0.62    1.62
LR6             0.5     1.0     1.0
BUT6            0.52    0.707   1.93
BUT7     X      0.55    0.8     2.24
LR8             0.54    0.54    1.31    1.31
BUT8            0.51    0.6     0.9     2.56

In the table above, the column '1st order' indicates whether a first order stage
is used to construct the named higher order filter. The columns labeled 'Q' 
indicate the pole Q (Qp) value for each second order filter used. The Fp of each
ACDf filter is set equal to the "corner frequency" of the overall filter for the
Linkwitz-Riley and Butterworth filter types.  

================================================================================     


Examples using Gstreamer:
Gstreamer converts each plugin name to a Gstreamer element name by compounding 
it with "ladspa" and parts of the plugin name. For example, in my current system
ACDf is listed as ladspa-acdf-so-acdf. You can list all the available LADSPA 
plugins available within Gstreamer using the command:
   gst-inspect-1.0 ladspa

In GSASysCon, each ACDf filter begins with "ladspa-acdf-so-acdf" followed by the
list of space-delimited parameter names and values, separated by the equals 
sign. Only values that you would like to set to be different than the default 
value need to be provided. See the table above for the default values for each 
parameter. When multiple filters are required, each should appear on its own 
line. 

Example 1: A second order Butterworth high-pass filter having a corner frequency
of 500 Hz, no gain, and normal polarity:
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=2 fp=500 qp=0.7071

Example 2: A fourth order Linkwitz-Riley high-pass filter at 2.2kHz with -6dB of
gain and normal polarity. From the table we can see that the LR4 type does not 
use a first order filter but uses two second order filters, each having a Qp 
of 0.707. The LR4 HP filter is constructed using two ACDf filters of type 22:
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=22 db=-6 fp=2200 qp=0.7071 
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=22 fp=2200 qp=0.7071
   
Example 3: A third order Butterworth low-pass filter having a corner frequency 
of 750Hz, reversed polarity, and no gain. From the table, we see that a BUT3 
filter uses a first order filter plus a second order filter with Qp=1. The BUT3
filter is constructed from these two ACDf filters:
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=1 polarity=-1 fp=750
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=21 fp=750 qp=1
   
Example 4: A 7th order Butterworth low-pass filter at 90Hz with normal polarity 
and no gain.
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=1 fp=90
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=21 fp=90 qp=0.55               
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=21 fp=90 qp=0.80               
   ladspa-acdf-so-acdf type=21 fp=90 qp=2.24
