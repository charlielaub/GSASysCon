About the Global Configuration File:
--------------------------------------------------------------
The global configuration file controls aspects of GSASysCon itself, as opposed
to audio systems that are run with GSASysCon. Global configuration files are 
found in the directory: 
   system_control/config
GSASysCon is supplied with a config file called "minimal_config.txt" that can
be used as a starting point for a single local system operating in "preamp 
mode". See below for further information regarding the use of the configuration
file for other purposes.

 
Global Configuration File Parameters:
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following parameters impact the look and behavior of GSASysCon. Note that 
most of these are optional except where indicated. The default value is shown
for parameters that have them. These are declared using the format:
   PARAMETER = value
except where indicated. When the default value is acceptable there is no need
to include the parameter in the global configuration file.

TIMEOUT_TIME
default value = 30 (seconds)
   number of seconds for 'run once' mode to time out

SYS_NUM_WIDTH
default value = 5 columns
   width of the system number field in the status output

RUNTIME_WIDTH
default value = 16 columns
   width of the runtime field in the status output

LOG_MAX_LINES
default value = 100
Sets the maximum number of lines to retain in the log file. The length of the 
file is check at startup, and the file is truncated as needed.

RAM_FS_ROOT
default value = /dev/shm
Because GSASysCon is disk intensive, it has been designed to copy all files into
memory and then operate there, so that the fixed disk is not over-used. The
parameter "RAM_FS_ROOT" points to the file location in memory. Linuxes have an
in-memory part of the file system. On most systems this is at /dev/shm but if 
your OS uses another location you can use a different path. Do not change this 
parameter unless you know what you are doing! 

DEBUG_INFO_PATH
default value = ~/GSASysCon_debug
This path is where debugging info is written The DEBUG state is not typically
used except for development and when doing error tracing. You may change this 
path to any that you prefer.

OPERATING_MODE = [ preamp | streaming ]
The OPERATING_MODE changes the behavior of GSASysCon in the following way. There
are two possible modes - preamp and streaming.
preamp mode: preamp mode enables the volume control feature. Only one "system"
   can be running at a time, and turning on a new system will turn off the 
   previous one. This mode makes GSASysCon function like the input side of a 
   preamp.
streaming mode: In this mode, the volume control is disabled. Any number of
   systems can be running at the same time. This allows GSASysCon to function 
   like the output (playback selection) side of an integrated amplifier that 
   has or had the knob to select A, B, A+B outputs. GSASysCon can support as
   many systems as the user would like to create, not just "A" and "B". The
   parameter AUDIO_SOURCE must be specified in the config file as a valid
   audio card, device or other source that will be used for all the systems
   running under a streaming mode instance of GSASysCon. 

SESSION_TITLE 
The session title appears at the top of the screen when GSASysCon has been 
launched in run-continuous mode. You can edit this field as you wish. 

SYSTEMS_FILEPATH 
The SYSTEMS_FILEPATH is an optional parameter. It should point to an existing
subdirectory of:
   system_control/system_info
This is only needed when two different instances of GSASysCon are used to mimic
a preamp, to keep separate the "systems" described for inputs and output. For
basic operation this variable is omitted or left blank

LOG_FILENAME
default value = logfile
The user can specify a name for the log file. This is useful when two different 
instances of GSASysCon are used to mimic a preamp, to keep separate the logs for
each instance, for example "output_log" and "input_log". Any valid name can be
used.  

SHOW_SYSTEM_MESSAGES
Include this flag (no field is assocated with it) to display additional messages
in the run_continuous text display. Because this is a flag, there is no value
to assign. Simply include the flag name in the file.

AUDIO_SOURCE
In streaming mode, all systems use the same audio source, so the parameter 
AUDIO_SOURCE must be included in the config file, and the SYSTEM_INPUT is 
omitted from the system_configuration files. The AUDIO_SOURCE could be the
output from the loopback, or any other audio source. 
   AUDIO_SOURCE=alsasrc device='dsnoop:Loopback,DEV=0' provide-clock=false ! \
      audio/x-raw,rate=96000,format=F32LE,channels=2








Example Configuration Files:
--------------------------------------------------------------

The minimal_config.txt file included with GSASysCon is set to run GSASysCon in
   the preamp mode, and uses only two parameters. The entire file is:
============================= ( begin file ) ===================================

#..............................................................................#
#          GSASysCon: the Gsreamer Streaming Audio System Controller           #

   SESSION_TITLE = GSASysCon:

==============================  ( end file ) ===================================





Dual Global Configuration Files for preamp-like operation:
--------------------------------------------------------------
In order to have multiple playback systems that can operate simultaneously, plus
input selection and volume control, you must run two independent instances of 
GSASysCon. Let's call these the "input" instance and the "output" instance. Each
instance must have its own configuration file, and the systems filepath should
be different for each since the input and output "systems" will be different and
should appear separately in each instance. The audio is routed from an input 
that is selected to be running via the input instance to the ALSA Loopback. The 
output instance takes this audio as its input, and then routes it to one or more
of the playback systems that are specified as output.

The file system could be set up like this:
|
|___system_info                  #folder must always have this name
        |
        |                        #new subfolders for input and output.
        |___inputs               #  name these as you wish...
        |      |___CD_player        
        |      |       |___system_configuration        
        |      |___Computer_Audio        
        |      |       |___system_configuration        
        |      |___Radio_Tuner        
        |               |___system_configuration        
        |___outputs
               |___kitchen        
               |       |___system_configuration        
               |___stube        
               |       |___system_configuration        
               |___wohnzimmer        
                       |___system_configuration        
   
The two global configuration files are placed in the directory:
   system_control                    #the top directory of GSASysCon
        |___config                   #contains global config file(s)
 
The two instances of GSASysCon are launched like this:
~/system_control/scripts/GSASysConV3.12.sh --config_file=input_config.txt -r 20
~/system_control/scripts/GSASysConV3.12.sh --config_file=output_config.txt -r 20
Each must be launched from its own terminal window (e.g. open two instances of
the bash termainal on the system). On my computer, this results in one terminal
showing the intputs:

AUDIO SOURCES:
   #       STATUS        SYSTEM NAME
----------------------------------------------------------
   1        OFF          CD player
   2   5hours,47mins     Computer Audio
   3        OFF          Radio Tuner
----------------------------------------------------------
Enter a system number to toggle it ON/OFF, x to exit

The other terminal shows the outputs:

PLAYBACK ENDPOINTS:
   #       STATUS        SYSTEM NAME
----------------------------------------------------------
   1   5hours,20mins     kitchen
   2        OFF          stube
   3   7hours,10mins     wohnzimmer
----------------------------------------------------------
Enter a system number to toggle it ON/OFF, x to exit



The global configuration file input_config.txt used for the input instance is:

OPERATING_MODE = preamp   #use preamp mode of operation

SESSION_TITLE = AUDIO SOURCES:

SYSTEMS_FILEPATH = inputs

LOG_FILENAME = input_logfile

SHOW_SYSTEM_MESSAGES  #display messages below system status

==============================  ( end file ) ===================================



The global configuration file output_config.txt used for the output instance is:
============================= ( begin file ) ===================================
#..............................................................................#
#          GSASysCon: the Gsreamer Streaming Audio System Controller           #
#                                                                              #
#                   Configuration Settings for OUTPUTS                         #
#..............................................................................#
TIMEOUT_TIME=30           #number of seconds for 'run once' mode to time out
SYS_NUM_WIDTH=5           #width of the system number field in the status output
RUNTIME_WIDTH=16          #width of the runtime field in the status output
LOG_MAX_LINES=500         #the number of lines to keep in the log file

OPERATING_MODE = streaming   #mode of operation is one of preamp or streaming

SESSION_TITLE = PLAYBACK ENDPOINTS:

SYSTEMS_FILEPATH = outputs

LOG_FILENAME = output_logfile

SHOW_SYSTEM_MESSAGES  #display messages below system status

# the alsa device used as input when GSASysCon runs in streaming mode:
AUDIO_SOURCE=alsasrc device='dsnoop:Loopback,DEV=0' provide-clock=false ! 
   audio/x-raw,rate=96000,format=F32LE,channels=2

==============================  ( end file ) ===================================

In the output_config.txt file, the AUDIO_SOURCE specifies the device or card 
that will be used for all output systems. As a result, the system configuration
file for output systems omits the SYSTEM_INPUT. Also, because the same audio
device or card must be capable of being connected to multiple GStreamer
piplines as the source, the dsnoop plug of the ALSA device is used here instead
of the hw: plug.
