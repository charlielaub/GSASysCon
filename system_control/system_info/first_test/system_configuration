#first_test system configuration file

#the Gstreamer source 'audiotestsrc' is used to generate an audio signal
#the caps string applies the audio rate and format to the source
#the two channels are routed from the system input to the client sink
#the Gstreamer sink 'fakesink' simply deletes the audio samples reaching it

#this system is only useful to check for a sucessful GSASysCon installation
#after the check has been completed sucessfully, this file and the directory 
#   that contains it can be deleted or modified
