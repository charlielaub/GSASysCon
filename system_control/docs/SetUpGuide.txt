An Overview of the Help Files:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of help files in the docs subfolder:
* help.txt - info about the command line options for GSASysCon. This file is
   written to screen if GSASysCon is run with the --help option or when no
   option or parameter is provided
* GSASysCon Basic Topics.txt - info about the system_configuration file, DSP
* GSASysCon Advanced Topics.txt - more in depth coverage of features, etc.
* Installing the ACDf LADSPA plugin.txt - how to install the included ACDf 
   LADSPA plugin used to perform DSP IIR filtering in GSASysCon
* ACDf_usage_notes.txt - usage info and help for the ACDf filters
* About the global configuration file.txt - the global configuration file
   controls how the GSASysCon app behaves and is located in the config dir
* Using the ALSAINFO app.txt - ALSAINFO is a helper program to determine valid
   audio formats and channel assignments for an alsa card under GStreamer
After following the setup steps below, it is recommended that you read through
these help files to better understand the capabilities and configuration of
GSASysCon.     




The GSASysCon File Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GStreamer Streaming Audio System Controller uses the following directory 
structure to store and organize information. When you install GSASysCon you 
install this entire directory structure. 

You may rename the top directory from system_control to any name that you would
like. The remaining directory names on the left, below (config to system_info), 
should remain unchanged. 

DIRECTORY                        USAGE
system_control                    the top directory of GSASysCon
|___config                        contains global config file(s)
|___docs                          help files and other docs
|___Examples                      example systems
|___filter_defs                   where filter definition files are located
|___LADSPA                        ladspa plugins, e.g. ACDf
|___license                       usage and license info
|___log                           log file
|___scripts                       GSASysCon and ALSAINFO shell scripts 
|___system_info                   one folder per system
        |
        |                         some example system folders:
        |___living_room_speaker               name the folder as you wish...
        |       |___system_configuration      but always use this filename!        
        |___bonus_room                        name the folder as you wish...
        |       |___system_configuration      but always use this filename!        
        |___back_patio                        name the folder as you wish...
                |___system_configuration      but always use this filename!        



The Location of User Systems with the File Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The user creates new directories within the system_info directory that are
called system folders. These must consist of the system name with spaces 
replaced by the underscore character. Example system folders that follow this 
convention are shown above. The folder name, with underscores replaced by 
spaces, will be shown in the GSASysCon control interface. 

In each system subdirectory, a file named "system_configuration" contains all 
of the information about the system, e.g. input, output, filters, etc. 




Installation Pre-requisites
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before performing the setup we will make sure that the necessary GStreamer 
components have been installed. When GStreamer is not installed or is only 
partially installed, GSASysCon can run but cannot launch any systems. 

First, type in a bash terminal window:
  gst-launch-1.0 --version

This command should return output that lists the version of GStreamer that is
installed on the machine. It is recommended to use version 1.20.x or higher. If
the command instead suggests that you install GStreamer, and/or you want to make
sure that you have all of the GStreamer, you may run the following commands (on 
Debian based systems such as Ubuntu and Raspberry OS):
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt -y install \ 
    GStreamer1.0-plugins-base \ 
    GStreamer1.0-plugins-good \
    GStreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
    GStreamer1.0-plugins-ugly \
    GStreamer1.0-libav \
    GStreamer1.0-tools \
    GStreamer1.0-alsa \ 
    GStreamer1.0-pulseaudio

NOTE: in the above lines, the backslash character "\" is a line-continuation
character. The first line with "update" is run first, and then all the 
remaining lines are run at once by copying them from this document, pasting 
them into the terminal window at the command prompt, and pressing the enter key.
If any packages are already installed they will just be skipped but any missing
packages will then be installed on the system. 

NOTE for OSes based on Fedora, see the instructions at:
https://GStreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html




Setup and First Test of GSASysCon:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Begin by opening a bash terminal window.

The first step is to enable execution of the GSASysCon shell script. Navigate 
to the 'system_control/scripts' subdirectory. Identify the GSASysCon shell 
script file having the most recent version (if there is more than one version 
present). This will have a filename like GSASysConV3.12.sh, where the last part
"3.12" is the version number. Run the command:
   ls -l
The first part of each line in the output indicates the read (r), write (w), 
and execute (x) flag for each file. The field should contain one or more "x" 
characters to indicate that the file(s)are executable. If not, enable execution
by typing:
   chmod +x ALSAINFO.sh
and
   chmod +x GSASysConV3.12.sh
substituting the correct version number for 3.12 above, if different.

Next, run the GSASysCon test system:
In the system_info folder there is a directory called "first_test" containing a 
system_configuration file. This file uses a "fake" GStreamer source and sink
that are not connected to any audio device. Run the system using the following
steps:
A. Enter the system_control/scripts directory

B. Run the GSASysCon script by typing: 
   ./GSASysConV3.12.sh --config_file=minimal_config.txt -r 10
If version 3.12 is not present, run the current/latest version of GSASysCon. 

C. You should see the following screen:
    GSASysCon:
       #       STATUS        SYSTEM NAME
    ----------------------------------------------------------
       1        OFF          first test
    ----------------------------------------------------------
Enter a system number to toggle it ON/OFF, x to exit   

Press "1" and then the ENTER key. The STATUS field should change and the screen
will now look like this:

    GSASysCon:
       #       STATUS        SYSTEM NAME
    ----------------------------------------------------------
       1        0sec         first test
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    Enter a system number to toggle it ON/OFF, x to exit

The STATUS field will automatically update every 10 seconds to reflect how long 
the system has been in the "ON" state. If the user presses ENTER without 
providing a system number the display is immediately refreshed and shows the 
elapsed time. You may try that now (press ENTER).

Finally, again press "1" followed by the ENTER key. The status should change 
back to "OFF". If this was successful, type "x" and press enter to exit  
GSASysCon and return to the command line. 


  


Installation the ACDf LADSPA plugin:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The final installation step is to install the LADSPA ACDf plugin. Open the file
"Installing the ACDf LADSPA plugin.txt" that is located in the docs directory 
and follow the instructions.  

If you are unfamiliar with ACDf or LADSPA you may read the file 
"ACDf_usage_notes.txt" located in the docs folder.

Once you complete the ACDf installation please read help file "GSASysCon basic 
Topics.txt" to better understand how audio systems are described in the 
system_configuration file. The examples provided there should help you create 
your first system with GSASysCon. 




GSASysCon Dependencies and the Required Bash Version:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to GStreamer, GSASysCon requires bash version 4.2 or later. You can
check the bash version available to you by typing:
   echo $BASH_VERSION
Bash 4.2 was released in 2011, and it is unlikely that you have an older 
version.

GSASysCon uses the following apps/functions/programs. These are typically 
included with the operating system and do not require installation:
amixer
awk
ss
nohup
ps
wc
cat
echo
tail
mkdir
copy
diff
readlink
dirname
basename
find

An SSH server such as openssh-server must be installed to use the remote 
client feature. Installation is described in the GSASysCon Advanced Topics
help document.
