README file for ACD-plugins v2.0

Installing LADSPA
~~~~~~~~~
LADSPA should be installed first. 

Check that the environment variable LADSPA_PATH is set and contains the
path to the plugins, so they can be found by a host.  

To set the environment variable try something like this:

export LADSPA_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ladspa:/usr/lib/ladspa

The export command should be placed in a file such as ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc or
a similar location that will be read on startup or login (note: the tilde (~) 
character indicates the user's home directory). 



Compiling and Installing the plugins
~~~~~~~~~
To install these plugins, type: 
   make
then   
   sudo make install

By default this installs plugins in /usr/local/lib/ladspa.  If
you want them to go somewhere else, edit the Makefile.



Optimizating the code for faster execution on your hardware
~~~~~~~~~
The Makefile does not include any flags that direct the compiler to generate 
code that makes use of special CPU processing that can speed up the execution 
of the code by several times or more, e.g. by using SSE. For instance the GCC 
march=CPU_type compiler option will try to optimize the code for the CPU 
indicated. Please consult the GCC man pages for more information. A web search 
about optimizing for your hardware is also a good resource.




Bug reports and Other Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~
Please send suggestions for improvements, bug reports, or comments to:
   ACD@claub.net

Thanks to all that came before me!

Enjoy,
