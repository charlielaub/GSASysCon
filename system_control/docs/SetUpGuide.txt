An Overview of the Help Files:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of help files in the docs subfolder:
* help.txt - info about the command line options for GSASysCon. This file is
   written to screen if GSASysCon is run with the --help option or when no
   option or parameter is provided
* GSASysCon Basic Topics.txt - info about the system_configuration file, DSP
* GSASysCon Advanced Topics.txt - more in depth coverage of features, etc.
* Installing the ACDf LADSPA plugin.txt - how to install the included ACDf 
   LADSPA plugin used to perform DSP IIR filtering in GSASysCon
* ACDf_usage_notes.txt - usage info and help for the ACDf filters
* About the global configuration file.txt - the global configuration file
   controls how the GSASysCon app behaves and is located in the config dir
* Using the ALSAINFO app.txt - ALSAINFO is a helper program to determine valid
   audio formats and channel assignments for an alsa card under GStreamer
After following the setup steps below, it is recommended that you read through
these help files to better understand the capabilities and configuration of
GSASysCon.     




The GSASysCon File Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GStreamer Streaming Audio System Controller uses the following directory 
structure to store and organize information. When you install GSASysCon you 
install this entire directory structure. 

You may rename the from system_control directory to any name that you would
like. The remaining directory names on the left, below (config to system_info), 
should remain unchanged. 

DIRECTORY                        USAGE
system_control                    the top directory of GSASysCon
|___config                        contains global config file(s)
|___docs                          help files and other docs
|___Examples                      example systems
|___filter_defs                   where filter definition files are located
|___LADSPA                        ladspa plugins, e.g. ACDf
|___license                       usage and license info
|___log                           log file
|___scripts                       GSASysCon and ALSAINFO shell scripts 
|___system_info                   one folder per system
        |
        |                         some example system folders:
        |___living_room_speaker               name the folder as you wish...
        |       |___system_configuration      but always use this filename!        
        |___bonus_room                        name the folder as you wish...
        |       |___system_configuration      but always use this filename!        
        |___back_patio                        name the folder as you wish...
                |___system_configuration      but always use this filename!        




The Location of User Systems with the File Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The user creates new directories within the system_info directory that are
called system folders. These must consist of the system name with spaces 
replaced by the underscore character. Example system folders that follow this 
convention are shown above. The folder name, with underscores replaced by 
spaces, will be shown in the GSASysCon control interface. 

In each system subdirectory, a file named "system_configuration" contains all 
of the information about the system, e.g. input, output, filters, etc. 




Enabling the Script Files:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must complete this step before performing either the Automated or Manual 
installation. 

Begin by opening a bash terminal window. We will enable execution for several 
GSASysCon related shell scripts. Navigate to the 'system_control/scripts' 
subdirectory and then run the command:
   chmod +x *.sh




Automated Installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After enabling the script files as described above, if you wish to run the 
automated installer remain in the system_control/scripts directory and type at
the command prompt:
   sudo ./Install.sh
This will perform all of the actions that are outlined below under "Manual
Installation" for you. 

At the end of the automated installation you will be asked if you would like to
run the "First Test of GSASysCon". It is strongly recommended that you do so at
that time.At the conclusion of the first test, the computer should be rebooted.




First Test of GSASysCon:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "first test" is intended to introduce you through using GSASysCon and test
that it is working properly.

In the system_info folder there is a directory called "first_test" containing a 
system_configuration file. This file uses a "fake" GStreamer source and sink
that are not connected to any audio device. These are used to check that the
GSASysCon installation was sucessful. Run the system using the following
steps:
A. Enter the system_control/scripts directory

B. Run the GSASysCon script by typing: 
   ./GSASysConV3.12.sh --config_file=minimal_config.txt -r 10
If version 3.12 is not present, run the current/latest version of GSASysCon. 

C. You should see the following screen:
    GSASysCon:
       #       STATUS        SYSTEM NAME
    ----------------------------------------------------------
       1        OFF          first test
    ----------------------------------------------------------
Enter a system number to toggle it ON/OFF, x to exit   

Press "1" and then the ENTER key. The STATUS field should change and the screen
will now look like this:

    GSASysCon:
       #       STATUS        SYSTEM NAME
    ----------------------------------------------------------
       1        0sec         first test
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    Enter a system number to toggle it ON/OFF, x to exit

The STATUS field will automatically update every 10 seconds to reflect how long 
the system has been in the "ON" state. If the user presses ENTER without 
providing a system number the display is immediately refreshed and shows the 
elapsed time. You may try that now (press ENTER).

Finally, again press "1" followed by the ENTER key. The status should change 
back to "OFF". If this was successful, type "x" and press enter to exit  
GSASysCon and return to the command line. 

After the first test please read help file "GSASysCon Basic Topics.txt" to 
better understand how audio systems are described in the system_configuration 
file. The examples provided there should help you create your first system with
GSASysCon. If you are unfamiliar with ACDf or LADSPA you may also want to read 
the file "ACDf_usage_notes.txt" located in the docs folder. ACDf filters form 
the basis of DSP within GSASysCon, however there is a simplified way to describe 
crossover filters and EQ that does not involve ACDf directly. The topic is 
introduced in the GSASysCon Basic Topics document. 

  


Manual Installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For most users the automated installer is the best option, however, all of the
steps for installation can also be performed manually and are listed below.

When GStreamer is not installed or is only partially installed, GSASysCon can 
run but cannot launch any systems. Therefore the first step is to check that 
the necessary GStreamer components have been installed and to install a few 
additional packages.  

Begin by opening a bash terminal window.

Run the following commands (on Debian based systems such as Ubuntu or 
Raspberry OS):
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt -y install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio ladspa-sdk build-essential

If any packages are already installed they will just be skipped but any missing
packages will be installed on the system. 

Next, add the LADSPA path to the end of your .profile file in your home 
directory so that the OS knows where to find LADSPA object files. This can be 
done by running the following command:
  echo 'export LADSPA_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ladspa:/usr/lib/ladspa' | tee -a ~/.profile

NOTE because this will not take effect until you either logout and then log 
back in to your account, or reboot, add the environmental variable to the 
current shell by typing at the command prompt:
  LADSPA_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ladspa

Now that LADSPA is installed on the system we are now ready to install the ACDf 
filters. In the directory:
   system_control/LADSPA
you will find subdirectories for the ACDf plugin and one or more optional
LADSPA plugins. To install ACDf, first enter the ACDf directory. You should see
files such as ACDf.cpp, README, makefile, etc. At the command prompt type:
   make
followed by:
   sudo make install

NOTE: You can generate a list of all installed LADSPA plugins using the command:
   listplugins
or
   gst-inspect-1.0 ladspa
ACDf should be found within the output of these commands.

You should now perform the steps described in the section called "First Test of
GSASysCon". At the conclusion of the first test, the computer should be
rebooted.





A List of GSASysCon Dependencies and the Required Bash Version:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to GStreamer, GSASysCon requires bash version 4.2 or later. You can
check the bash version available to you by typing:
   echo $BASH_VERSION
Bash 4.2 was released in 2011, and it is unlikely that you have an older 
version.

GSASysCon uses the following apps/functions/programs. These are typically 
included with the operating system and do not require installation:
amixer
awk
ss
nohup
ps
wc
cat
echo
tail
mkdir
copy
diff
readlink
dirname
basename
find

An SSH server such as openssh-server must be installed to use the remote 
client feature. Installation is described in the GSASysCon Advanced Topics
help document.
