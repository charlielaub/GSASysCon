                          Usage Information:
Syntax:
  GSASysCon.sh --config_file=filename [option]

Option:                                              Program Mode:
  -r | --run update_interval                     :continuous run mode
  -r | --run 1                                   :run-once mode
  -a | --auto sys_num|sys_name ON|OFF            :automated mode
  -k | --killall                                 :turns all systems off
  -h | --help                                    :prints this help
  -c | --copyright                               :prints (C) info
  -v | --version                                 :prints version info


Rules:
Only one program mode and its parameters (if any) may be listed.
The name of the system configuration file must be provided as a command option -
note that this file must reside in the directory: system_control/config

Program Modes:

Continuous Run Mode:
In this mode the system status is continuously displayed after update_interval 
seconds have elapsed without user input. Like with run-once mode, the user can
choose an action to take. Following the action, the system status is again
displayed. The user must manually exit the interface by typing x at the prompt.

Run-Once Mode:
In this mode the system status is displayed and the user can choose one action
to take. After performing the action the program prints the new status and exits.
If no user input is received for some time the program automatically exits.

Automated Mode:
This functions like run-once mode. Rather than getting the desired action from
the user, the action is specified on the command line. Actions can consist of
turning a system on or off, with system system specified by its number or by
the system directory name.

Killall Mode:
The program attempts to terminate all systems whether they are on or not. The
program then exits when called from the command line directly. This mode may
also be invoked inside Run-Once or Run-Continuous operation modes by entering
a 'k'. 



Control while in Run-Once and Run-Continuous Modes:
The program lists the systems based on the system directories found in
system_control/system_info as well as their status. The status is either 'OFF' 
or the elapsed time that the system has been in the ON state. The following is
a list of permissable actions when in the run-once and run-continuous modes:

   # = toggle system # on/off (enter the system number in place of "#") 
   0 = turn all systems off
   x = exit
   v = enter volume control environment
   m = enter volume control environment and immediately mute
   r = refresh the display
   M = toggles display of system messages
   k = kill all
   d = toggles debug-no-run mode on/off
   D = toggles debug-run mode on/off

The system number is automatically generated by arranging the systems in 
alphabetical order and may change as systems are added or deleted.

When in volume control environment use the "u" key to turn the volume up, and 
the "d" key to turn the volume down. The "v" key exits the volume control mode.
For more info about the volume control see: "GSASysCon Advanced Topics.txt" in
the docs directory.
